A task manager that works like a bugtracker

frontend:
NativeScript/Angular. And luck.

Backend:
Data transferred and stored via JSON.
Flask server i guess?
Authomatic for auth


So far, no need to modularize the json. All the server does is pushing new json files.
Oh, and validating. LOOOOOTS of validating.
